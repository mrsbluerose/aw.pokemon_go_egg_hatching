# pokemon_go_egg_hatching
This app helps a user determine when to place their Pokemon Go eggs in incubators in order to hatch them all at the same time. Doing so can help increase the player's XP gain by timing all the hatching with a luck egg XP bonus or special event bonus. The three main options include: displaying a reference table with or without event multipliers, calculating an individual egg hatch time and calculating an egg-placement plan based on the user's current inventory.

Currently, this project is meant for personal use and is serving as a demonstration of my coding.

## Status
In the works: Charted Plan class calculations (determining whether to use data structures or classes)
Future expansion: Incorporating Swing interface to reduce user prompts and improve data validation

##Getting Started
These options will help you set up the program in your local environment. Currently, this only runs in an IDE.

###Prerequisites
No prerequisites other than having an IDE set for Java

###Installing
1. Create a project called pokemon_go_egg_hatching
2. Import the src/pokemongoeggs file 

##Running Tests
No incorporated testing at this time (other than print statements)
User input errors not handled. Will be incorporating Swing GUI to enforce data validation.

##Contributing
No outside contributing at this time.

##Versioning
Original version in progress.
Future expansion: incorporate Swing GUI
